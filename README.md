###SiteGenerator

Tool for converting XML files to HTML using XSL transformations. 

A hierarchical navigation will be implemented using a separate XSL template, directory names serve as content IDs.

Source files including images and css are stored in one place and we will set them up in a separate target directory.

###Syntax

```
sitegenerator.exe [source directory] [target directory]
```

###Remarks

Currently my sample source files are part of the project for convenience, this would of course not be the case when used for any production purposes.
